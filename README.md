# About Us:

We are TAROTS! Our names are Jessica Yin, Lilyan Dania Aljafari, and Eman Razeq from Madison Academic High School in Jackson. We used the DevCatalyst Experience to build a website for [Crocker Construction Co.](crockerconstruction.com) of Jackson. Their original website was outdated, so we feel ours gives a newer, cleaner feel for users. 

### Some changes we made:
* Clearer organization of information
* Clearer navigational layout
* Made all pages available through navbar
* Removed outdated info & added updated info
* Created visually appealing page layout
* Added cards for team members and projects
* Simpler visuals that emphasize project photography
* Scrolling carousels for projects
* Logical layout of pages and information
