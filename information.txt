who we are:

    Founded in 1950 by Morris Crocker, the 
    company focused primarily on multi-residential 
    projects through the 60s and 70s with an 
    occasional commercial or small industrial 
    project. When Hal Crocker reestablished Crocker 
    Construction after his father's retirement in 1986 
    he changed its focus to commercial and industrial 
    construction with an emphasis on design/build projects.

what we do:

    Crocker Construction is a leader in the community 
    through the steady growth of new commercial 
    construction, restoration projects and maintenance 
    of industrial properties. We operate with a “team 
    build” philosophy. This is a philosophy in which 
    everyone, including the client, is part of the team.
